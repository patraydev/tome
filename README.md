## Overview

_**The Tome** is a searchable, community-driven cocktail database. Optimized to run on a restaurant POS tablet, this app will allow users to view a complete collection of cocktail recipes from their bar program, build their own library of recipes, and submit new cocktails as well as giving beverage directors and owners the option of sharing their recipes into the cloud in exchange for access to the recipes of other programs that have enabled sharing._

## MVP


_**The Tome** MVP will encompass:_

# Server (Back End)

    *Build a RESTful JSON API.
        **Build a Ruby on Rails server, exposing RESTful JSON endpoints.
        **Build a database with at tables as defined in the ERD:
        **Implement working generic controller actions for Full CRUD (index, show, **create, update, delete) between non-User tables

# Client (Front End)

    *Build a working, interactive React app.
    **Consume data from Rails API, and render that data in components.
    **Utilize React Router, for client-side routing.
    **Demonstrate Full CRUD actions on the front end.

# Styling

    **Style with CSS Flexbox and Grid.
    **Implement 2 media queries for responsive design on 3 screen sizes (including desktop).

# Linting

    **Indent properly.
    **Utilize high-quality, semantic variable names.
    **Follow camelCase, snake_case, and kebab-case convention.
    **Remove unnecessary boilerplate React files and code.
    **Remove all console.log()s and commented out code.

# Deployment

    **Deploy the fully functional front-end via Surge or Netlify.
    **Deploy the back-end via Heroku.
